        "Lytics takes great care to securely store any tokens or authorization credentials necessary to maintain connection to up or downstream channel tools. Upon submitting any type of auth credentials, such as oAuth or key/secret, an \"authorization\" record is created in our account database. This contains the contextual information such as author, description, etc, as well as an encrypted copy of your credentials.",
        "When it comes to the encryption we adhere to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to ensure credentials are never surfaced in a consumable way outside of our backend system processing. Any API calls will result in returning either no credentials or an encrypted version of the credentials.",
        "AES, or Advanced Encryption Standard, is a block cipher that was selected by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the standard for the encryption of electronic data. AES is a symmetric cipher, which means that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. AES is a block cipher, which means that it operates on data in blocks of 128 bits. AES has three key sizes: 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits. The 128-bit key size is the most common, but the 192-bit and 256-bit key sizes are also secure.",
        "AES is a secure algorithm because it has a large key space and a complex structure. The key space is the number of possible keys that can be used to encrypt data. The larger the key space, the more difficult it is to break the encryption. AES has a key space of 2128, which is an extremely large number. The complex structure of AES makes it difficult to find weaknesses in the algorithm.",
        "AES has been extensively tested and has not been broken to date. It is widely used by governments, businesses, and individuals to protect sensitive data."

        "SSO helps the end user. Implementing SSO means employees are required to commit just one password to memory. With one password to remember, a user can easily create and remember a unique and secure password without writing it down. SSO reduces password fatigue and frustration and makes the employee more efficient.",
        "SSO benefits the company. Fewer passwords to remember equals fewer calls to the helpdesk, resulting in more time spent on other tasks for both the end user and IT. Fewer calls to the helpdesk (which is oftentimes outsourced) means a reduction in cost to the company as well.",
        "SSO improves security. When employees are required to remember numerous passwords, it is easy to fall into lazy habits, such as using simple, easy-to-remember passwords, which are more susceptible to hacking. Or writing passwords down on Post-it notes where they can easily be stolen or fall into the wrong hands.",

        "Once implemented, users will log in to Lytics via a special SSO form that only requires an email address. Lytics will recognize the email address and open a pop-up to the user's IdP to complete the login. Once the IdP verifies credentials, the pop-up will close, redirecting the user to a logged-in instance of their Lytics dashboard. Behind the scenes, a customer's IdP will communicate with the Lytics APIs, which use Google Cloud Identity Platform to validate the login. This document describes the process for integrating with a new IdP that uses SAML.",
        "To configure SAML for the Lytics service provider, some information is required about your IdP. If you have a metadata file that contains SAML provider information, this may be appropriate, but please ensure that the following information is provided to Lytics Support:",
        "Further configuration details, such as mappings, may need to be provided, but the Lytics implementation only requires the email address field to be mapped. Once this information has been received, Lytics can configure the SAML connection in the Google Cloud Identity Platform.",
        "After Lytics configures the SAML connection on the service provider, Lytics Support will provide the following key fields of information to the customer to complete the configuration in their IdP.",
        "With this information, your IdP connection can be configured to complete the SSO integration.",
        "At this time, Lytics does not support providing this information in an XML metadata file. Additional information about the Service Provider may be provided on request.",
        "Once all the information has been configured in both the IdP and the Lytics service provider, you can test and verify that the SSO implementation works as expected. If you are using SSO as your only sign-in method, please disable any password restriction or expiration settings that may have been enabled in the UI.",
        "During the testing process, Lytics can be configured to allow both SSO login and regular username and password (or Google OAuth) login through the app. This allows users to test SSO without disrupting the day-to-day usage of the app.",
        "If requested, once the SSO implementation has been tested and verified, Lytics can disable the use of other login types for an account.",
        "If it's known that SSO will be added to an account, the user email addresses added to the account should match the email address present within the IdP. If the email address doesn’t match, the login will fail as Lytics will not be able to verify that there is a user with that email address.",
        "For instance, if the email listed in the IdP is abc@123 and within Lytics, it is def@456, then there will be potentially multiple error points for a user trying to log in via the SSO form on Lytics.",
        "If the user enters abc@123 into the IdP pop-up, it will immediately fail as we use the Lytics account user to determine which IdP to redirect to. You would see an error message like the following:",
        "",
        "However, should the user enter def@456 (their Lytics account email), they will be redirected to their IdP, but the verification of the login will fail once information is sent back to Lytics.",
        "To remedy this situation, you would need to create a new user within Lytics with the email address abc@123 for the SSO login to be successful.  You can check, add, and remove users for an account using the Managing Users guide as a reference.",
        "Lytics Support can assist in the troubleshooting process. When testing for the first time, Lytics can enable logging to help troubleshoot any issues you encounter. With this, the team can help debug if you provide information on the login attempt, such as the login time, user, and account.",
        "If you’re encountering a verification error, but you've checked that your emails from the IdP and Lytics match, this may be an issue with the SAML configuration either on the IdP or SP side. Contact Lytics Support with details of the issue, and our team can coordinate a fix.",
        "It should also be noted that primary accounts (master accounts) are decided as the first account that a user was added to.  Due to this,  users from a single group/organization will often have different primary accounts. This is important for SSO as it will also be the account the user is logged into at the start of their session. If SSO is enabled as the only means of login on one account and a user attempts to log in using Google OAuth or their username and password, the login session will fail. The following options are possible solutions:",
        "Configuring Role Assertions for SSO in Lytics",
        "The Lytics team can configure Single Sign-On (SSO) to assign roles via SSO. This configuration must be applied to the primary (master) accounts and any additional accounts to which users need access. For more information, refer to the account structure with SSO.",
        "Important Note:\nUsers cannot be assigned to additional accounts via SSO alone; they must be manually invited to each Lytics account to which they need access.",
        "To set up role assignments via SSO, customers must configure their Identity Provider (IDP) to include a group assertion for each account the user can access. The role of each user must be specified in the format:\nlytics_<AID>_<Role>",
        "Example of a SAML assertion for a user whose default account is 123 and also has access to account 234:",
        "Note: This example is simplified to focus only on the group's assertion; a real-world example would be more detailed.",
        "The following roles can be assigned:",
        "This document will walk you through how to implement Single Sign-On to the Lytics application with Okta as an identity provider. Lytics has applied to become an official Okta partner application. Still, while the partnership is being established, you can follow these instructions to set up the custom application in Okta, which covers the IDP configuration portion of the implementation.",
        "From your Okta Administration panel, navigate to Applications and then Add Application and Create New App.",
        "Under Platform, select Web, and for Sign on Method, choose SAML 2.0.",

          "SSO helps the end user. Implementing SSO means employees are required to commit just one password to memory. With one password to remember, a user can easily create and remember a unique and secure password without writing it down. SSO reduces password fatigue and frustration and makes the employee more efficient.",
          "SSO benefits the company. Fewer passwords to remember equals fewer calls to the helpdesk, resulting in more time spent on other tasks for both the end user and IT. Fewer calls to the helpdesk (which is oftentimes outsourced) means a reduction in cost to the company as well.",

When employees are required to remember numerous passwords, it is easy to fall into lazy habits, such as using simple, easy-to-remember passwords, which are more susceptible to hacking. Or writing passwords down on Post-it notes where they can easily be stolen or fall into the wrong hands.",

        "Lytics offers a wide range of pre-packaged user attributes, including automatically generated and customizable ones. Additionally, Lytics employs predictive modeling and machine learning algorithms to provide insights and scores, allowing users to gain a deeper understanding of their audience. The guide below provides an overview of all available attributes and examples to enhance your profiling efforts.",
        "If you haven't already reviewed our documentation on collecting events via our JavaScript SDK, we highly recommend doing so first. This will give you a better understanding of how data collection works at a high level before delving into the specifics of what can be collected.",
        "The following attributes are all available out of the box with no customization necessary in all Lytics pricing tiers. Do note that any attributes flagged as Computed can not be edited directly but are computed based on various factors, including other non-computed attributes.",
        "For a more comprehensive example of how any of the following attributes can be collected and used for your visitors click the name of the identifier to access the code examples below.",
        "Default attributes that are used to stitch profiles together. For instance, if you pass an email along with the _uid, all events that have only been associated with either identifier will be merged into a single comprehensive profile.",
        "Details encompass all default attributes related to user demographics and general information, including name, phone number, status, etc. It serves as a catch-all for attributes not specifically tied to interactions or behaviors.",
        "Meta encompasses all system-level information that provides insights into the health and breadth of the profile. This includes data such as creation date, last update timestamp, source information, and other metadata associated with the profile's management and maintenance. Metadata offers a behind-the-scenes view of the profile's overall status and administration.",
        "Behavioral attributes typically cannot be directly managed but represent a set of insights derived from a user's behavior over time. These insights are invaluable when personalizing experiences based on changes in behavior or behaviors indicative of high likelihood. For instance, you might want to present a premium offer to users exhibiting higher momentum than usual. Behavioral attributes enable targeted and timely interventions tailored to user actions and patterns.",
        "Interests entail understanding the topics a user is interested in based on their interactions, cross-referenced by deep programmatic analysis of their online activities. This allows for tailored content recommendations and targeted messaging aligned with the user's preferences and engagement history.",
        "Attributes classified as intelligence encompass diverse, highly valuable information to facilitate relevant and high-value personalized experiences. Within this category, you'll discover real-time segment membership, values crucial for split testing and experimentation, and direct correlation to our real-time machine learning modeling. These attributes empower dynamic and data-driven decision-making, enhancing the efficacy of personalized marketing strategies.",
        "Activity encompasses the user's engagement across different channels and campaigns, including clicks and conversions. It provides valuable insights into recent interactions, aiding campaign optimization and channel effectiveness assessment.",
        "This is an automatically generated canonical ID managed by Lytics. It refers to the materialized profile and cannot be customized or overridden.",
        "_uid represents the Lytics anonymous 1st party cookie. This value is automatically captured with every jstag.send() call from the JavaScript tag. The only way to customize this value is to explicitly set the value of _uid, which we do not recommend.",
        "By default, the Lytics JavaScript SDK will collect language information based on the browser, but this can be overridden.",
        "Lytics automatically generate this and represents the oldest event associated with the user.",
        "This is automatically generated by Lytics and represents the last time the user was modified.",
        "This is automatically generated by Lytics and represents the last time the users scores were updated.",
        "This is automatically generated by Lytics and represents the number of aliases associated with the user.",
        "This is automatically generated by Lytics and represents the number of days the user has existed.",
        "This is automatically generated by Lytics and represents the number of events associated with the user.",
        "This is automatically generated by Lytics and represents the number of streams associated with the user.",
        "This is automatically generated by Lytics and represents the names of the streams associated with the user.",
        "This is automatically generated by Lytics and represents whether the user has been flagged as a bot or not.",
        "The following attributes are all computed in real-time as the profile evolves. Each of the behavioral attributes are surfaced as a score between 0 and 100. These scores represent an aggregate summary of the user's behavior across various dimensions: Consistency, Frequency, Intensity, Maturity, Momentum, Propensity, Quantity, Recency, and Volatility.",
        "The interest attributes are computed in real-time and represent the user's interest in various topics. These topics are generated as a result of the analysis done by the Lytics Interest Engine and then associated with the user based upon their interaction with content on your site.",
        "This attribute displays an array of all segments the user is currently a member of. It updates in real-time based on various audience definitions. Lytics offers a range of useful segments out of the box, requiring no additional setup. For detailed information on these audiences, refer to our Developer Tier > Audiences documentation.",
        "These attributes are automatically generated by Lytics and represent a random value evenly distributed across users. They are useful for split testing and experimentation.",
        "This attribute is computed in real-time and represents the relative distance between now and the next predicted event. It is stream specific and is useful for understanding when a user is likely to engage again.",
        "This attribute is computed in real-time and represents the next expected event. It is stream specific and is useful for understanding when a user is likely to engage again.",
        "This attribute is computed in real-time and represents the scores resulting from Lytics Lookalike and SegmentML models. Out-of-the-box, Lytics offers a range of useful models, requiring no additional setup. For detailed information on these models, refer to our Developer Tier > Models documentation.",
        "Both of these attributes are automatically populated based upon the _e value in the jstag.send payload. By default Lytics will collect a pv event for each page view and this will automatically populate the first_seen and last_seen attributes. Below is an example of collecting a custom event that would populate these attributes as well.",
        "This attribute is automatically populated with a count of events per hour for the user.",
        "This attribute is automatically populated with a count of events per hour of the week for the user.",
        "This attribute is automatically populated with the last time an event was received in any stream for the user.",
        "This attribute is automatically populated with the domains the user has been active on.",
        "This attribute is automatically populated with the first time the user visited the site and sends data to the default stream.",
        "This attribute is automatically populated with the last time the user visited the site and sends data to the default stream.",
        "This attribute is automatically populated with the number of _pv events recieved for the user.",
        "This attribute is automatically populated with the referring domain for the user.",
        "This attribute is automatically populated based on the user agent of the browser. This attribute must be turned on in your Lytics account to be collected.",
        "This attribute is automatically populated with the number of visits the user has had based on presence of the _sesstart key in an event.",
        "This attribute is automatically populated with the city the user visited from based upon GeoIP.",
        "This attribute is automatically populated with the country the user visited from based upon GeoIP.",
        "This attribute is automatically populated with the region the user visited from based upon GeoIP.",

        "This document outlines how to leverage Lytics' real-time personalization engine to identify visitors who lack the strong identifiers necessary to link web-based behavioral insights with other activation channels such as email.",
        "Traditionally, lead capture involves gathering information from individuals interested in your products or services, such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. This occurs when people visit your website, subscribe to your newsletter, download resources, or interact with your content. However, in recent years, the role of lead capture within your global consumer engagement strategy has undergone significant transformation.",
        "Lytics' real-time personalization engine lets you first identify the current web visitor, programmatically review their profile, and ultimately decide if a campaign should be delivered to their browser to close gaps in that profile.",
        "",
        "Below, you'll find a detailed guide on how to execute this use case. At the end, you'll find additional reading, which will help you learn how to extend and customize this use case further.",
        "Before executing this use case, your website must be properly configured with the core Lytics SDK (JavaScript tag). Please refer to our installation documentation to confirm the tag is present before continuing.",
        "As an admin user of Lytics, you can enable or disable any attributes from being surfaced to the web via our JavaScript SDK. Depending on how your account has been configured, you may need to allow some of the required attributes for this particular use case.",
        "Required Attributes:",
        "To execute this use case, we will launch a simple lead capture form at the bottom left of your site. The lead capture will focus on collecting email addresses for the user and use a generic \"dark\" theme along with some boilerplate messaging. For best results, we recommend leveraging an offer of some sort that will resonate with your customers to entice them to \"sign up\" and identify themselves. In return, you'll gain much knowledge about this visitor, strengthen your consumer record, and unlock the ability to connect in channels outside of just the web.",
        "You can extend this use case to progressively improve your visitor profiles by surfacing data capture forms specific to gaps in their profile data. For instance, when they are unknown, only ask for email. As soon as you have an email, perhaps you want to know more about their preferences or learn how to improve a particular portion of your product/offering.",
        "The Lytics platform has a pre-defined schema to facilitate this use case. As such, we recommend building a custom report from within our UI to showcase your progress in converting unknown or anonymous visitors to known visitors with a strong identifier. There are many ways to configure this type of reporting, but here we'll guide you through a basic example to measure impact.",
        "",
        "Step 1: Once you have created your new report, add a component using the \"+ Add New Component\" button at the top of the report.",
        "Step 2: Select \"Size\" as your component type.",
        "Step 3: Name your component. We recommend something simple like \"Anonymous vs. Known\".",
        "Step 4: Add an optional description to explain the goal of this report to ease the consumption for others later.",
        "Step 5: Select the audiences you'd like to highlight. In this use case, we'll select \"Anonymous Profiles\" and \"Known Profiles\", which are both available by default.",
        "Step 6: Save your component. Please note it may take some time for the report to populate once you have configured it, but as long as you see the empty \"Not enough data\" state, you are good to go.",
        "Step 1: Following steps similar to the previous component, we'll add another component, but this time, we use the \"Composition\" component type.",
        "Step 2: Name your component \"Campaign Impressions,\" as this component will focus on showcasing impression information to validate that the campaign is being shown.",
        "Step 3: Select the \"All\" audience to ensure all visitors, regardless if they are known or unknown, are included in the report.",
        "Step 4: Select the field \"ly_impressions.\" This field represents an array of all campaigns each visitor has interacted with and is available by default. The values returned for custom campaigns will match the \"ID\" you set above in the campaign configuration.",
        "Step 5: Finally, replace \"my_campaign_id\" in the example below with the ID of your campaign above to highlight only interactions for that campaign.",
        "Following the same steps as above, configure another \"Composition\" component, but this time, use the field \"ly_conversions\" as it will be an array of all campaigns your users have converted on instead of the impressions used previously.",
        "Thats it. Your report has been configured. As you begin to gain impressions and conversions, this report will populate. Generally, every hour or two, to highlight the impact.",
        "Get additional guidance on how to pass interaction information related to your campaign to the following common sources for additional reporting and insight discovery:",
        "Once you have configured and tested your Experience, activation is as simple as publishing the JavaScript code to your site. This may be done via a tag manager like Google Tag Manager or using another mechanism such as Drupal blocks or WordPress.",

This is achieved through a detailed enrichment and affinity generation process in real-time. While full details are available in Lytics' comprehensive documentation, the core process can be distilled into four key steps:",
        "This streamlined framework enables real-time personalization, enhancing user experience by continuously adapting to evolving visitor interests.",
        "Relevant content for individual users boosts marketing effectiveness and ROI by increasing engagement and conversion rates. Personalized content meets users' interests, leading to better resource utilization and higher customer retention. This targeted strategy enhances sales opportunities and brand perception, directly improving return on investment.",
        "Lytics' real-time personalization engine lets you first identify the current web visitor, programmatically review their profile, and deliver one or more pieces of content based on their unique interests to maximize engagement.",
        "Below, you'll find a detailed guide on how to execute this use case. At the end, you'll find additional reading, which will help you learn how to extend and customize this use case further.",
        "Before executing this use case, your website must be properly configured with the core Lytics SDK (JavaScript tag). Please refer to our installation documentation to confirm the tag is present before continuing.",
        "Your content must be classified before Lytics can offer content recommendations or insights. Typically, this classification process takes 24 to 48 hours, though it may extend if your catalog is particularly large. To ensure the health of your content graph and interest engines, there are a few key areas to focus on:",
        "If you have not already verified the quality of classification and metadata, please refer to our quickstart documentation.",
        "From the Lytics interface, navigate to Decision Engine from the product switcher at the top left.",
        "Using the left-hand menu, navigate to Content > Collections.",
        "From the list of collections, there is likely only one; look for All Content in the list and the rows Size. This refers to the number of documents classified; it should be greater than one and reflect your total catalog.",
        "For greater detail, you can also visit Content > Web Classification.",
        "At the top of that page will be a summary dashboard of all content that has been successfully classified and cataloged. Most notably, the All Documents count under the URL Path component.",
        "We will use the default collection outlined below for this exercise, but you may also create a custom collection with a subset of your content to recommend.",
        "Ready to go a step farther and build a custom collection of your content to ensure recommendations are selected from a more currated set of documents? Check out our full documentation.",
        "As an admin user of Lytics, you can enable or disable any attributes from being surfaced to the web via our JavaScript SDK. Depending on how your account has been configured, you may need to allow some of the required attributes for this particular use case.",
        "Required Attributes:",

Data Managers, Campaign Managers, Experience Managers, and Goal Managers can access the Authorizations section to manage the credentials for their jobs and experiences. Finally, all Lytics users, regardless of role, should have access to view the JavaScript tag installation page under Account Setup, and they should be able to view their user profile where they can change details such as their Name, Email Address, Phone Number (for two-factor authentication) and change their password. Your user profile will be accessible under the main Lytics navigation under \"Manage My Profile.\"",

The details on each role are shown in a tooltip when you hover over the role name.",

As used below, personally identifiable information (PII) has the same meaning in the CCPA and is meant to include “personal data” as defined in the GDPR. Please consult your company’s legal counsel or privacy professional about what privacy and data protection requirements your company must comply with.",

Each Lytics customer maintains control over which PII sources and destinations to use with Lytics and the types and content of PII shared between its sources and destinations.

These fields will be hidden for anyone who does not have Admin, Data Manager, or User Search roles. You should verify with Lytics Support that the field hiding in the segment scan is also enabled for your account to ensure these fields are also hidden there.",

One consent mechanism is to implement a custom tag and trigger in your Google Tag Manager account and assign that trigger to the Lytics JS tag. See how to manage consent with Google Tag Manager.",
        "For sites not using Google Tag Manager, customer consent on the web can be managed in several ways. Consent triggers can be listened to by adding a snippet of custom JavaScript to your site. Another alternative is to use a cookie-consent solution, many of which exist. Github has documented a free solution, including demos. The Lytics JS Tag can be configured to consume triggers from any of these solutions to manage consent for your customers.",

These audiences can be exported from Lytics to your downstream tools or \"data destinations.\"",

        "Announcements about browsers changing their cookie tracking policies have created tremendous concern and confusion within marketing and advertising industries, and rightfully so. These changes represent dramatic shifts in how users and their activity are tracked across the web.",
        "Browsers are removing third-party cookies and altering the default behavior of first-party cookies, which makes first-party data mission-critical for marketers more than ever before. The following explains how current and upcoming browser changes will impact your web tracking involving Lytics.",
        "The blocking of third-party cookies, whether by browser default or user choice, will significantly impact the effectiveness, if not viability, of ad targeting, retargeting, attribution, and measurement efforts dependent on the use of third-party cookies. In addition, Apple’s ITP 2.2 impacts certain marketing use cases.",
        "For Safari users, cookies get cleared after seven days if there is no activity. So if a user visits a site once and returns eight days later, their cookie will be gone. However, if that user returns every day for eight days, their cookie will remain intact.",
        "This can skew analytics, impact personalization efforts for anonymous users, and affect conversion attribution. But put it in perspective, while Safari accounts for over half of mobile web traffic in the US for non-mobile and worldwide browser usage, Safari’s market share is around 20 percent as of January 2020.",
        "More importantly, these browser changes continue the trend of giving individuals more control over what brands/entities they want to engage with and transparency in that regard. They point to the need for brands to maximize relevant content or offerings for a site visitor in real-time, which can lead to registration or other means of establishing a known, first-party relationship. These browser changes reflect the change from a model that exploits third-party data outside an established relationship to transparently establishing and cultivating a relationship with the consumer for mutual benefit.",
        "The good news is Lytics was designed to help companies establish first-party relationships with their customers and implement intelligent identity resolution strategies. Lytics enables you to collect and leverage first-party data in various ways, such as: acquiring new customers, serving ads on-site with highly targeted audiences, and promoting relevant content to users based on their interests.",
        "Onto the technical details. To understand how these browser changes will impact the Lytics JavaScript tag (aka Tracking Tag) you must first understand the core mechanics of how Lytics builds profiles for your anonymous visitors.",
        "It all begins with Lytics’ unique client-side identifier, which is referred to as the UID or _uid. When a user visits your web property for the first time, the Lytics tag generates a unique value for this UID and stores it as a browser cookie. This UID is then appended to any behavioral data collected from their visit. Typically when a user returns after a subsequent visit, this UID persists since it has been stored as a cookie.",
        "The impact of cookie changes on this process will vary by browser. In the case of Safari, for example, it means that if a user does not return within seven days, that particular identifier will be deleted. As such, it will become imperative to double down on your identity resolution strategies and ensure that efforts are being made to associate first-party anonymous cookies with other known identifiers that can persist, such as user IDs upon login.",
        "In addition, some customers leverage the loadid parameter as part of their tag configuration. Historically, this has enabled a simple method for resolving identities across web properties. This loadid method relies on third-party cookies, which are impacted heavily by these cookie changes. Like the first-party implications above, cross-domain identity resolution strategies become more important.",
        "To date, efforts have been made to rely less on browser cookies, given their uncertain nature. Version 3 of the Lytics JavaScript tag was built to be more secure and flexible**, allowing Lytics to respond to these types of changes more efficiently. At the end of the day, however, restricting or removing cookies, in general, will affect the way that you, the marketer, use and monitor the web. Focusing on safe, secure, and transparent resolution strategies is at the core of the Lytics platform, and we believe will allow any marketer to overcome these changes in the future.",
        "Q. What cookies are issued in connection with the Lytics tag?",
        "By default, Lytics sets a cookie seerid that is used to identify a user. This is then surfaced in a users profile as _uid. Out of the box, this is what our JavaScript tag uses for web-based identity resolution.",
        "Q. Are Lytics’ cookies first-party cookies or third-party cookies?",
        "When issued by the client website domain on which they run, Lytics’ cookies are treated by browsers as first-party cookies. This is the case for all of our clients. In some cases, clients have established separate top-level domains for two or more of their brands. In these cases, many have leveraged an optional identity resolution aid that allows Lytics to store the same identifier as a third-party cookie. This allows for a hands-off approach to resolve identities across domains but in no way impacts the nature of our first-party cookies described above.",
        "Lytics has enabled a “cookie culling” feature that prevents “stale” (old) cookies from being used as identifiers to stitch the user profile fragments. Given the browser cookie limits mentioned above, this ensures only valid identifiers will be used to build your Lytics user profiles, which helps keep them clean and consolidated.",
        "For example, if a Safari user visits your site once and doesn’t return within two months, Lytics can remove this cookie from their first visit as it has become “stale.” There is no reason to keep this cookie as an identifier because it can’t be used for personalization. Lytics recommends opting for a maximum of 60 days to keep cookies, but this setting can be customized according to your needs. Don't hesitate to contact your Lytics Account Manager if you are interested in enabling this cookie-culling feature.",
        "Once Lytics removes cookies after your specified time frame, not only the “stale” cookies are removed, but any other profile fragments attached to those cookies will be omitted from the stitching process. As a result, any associated data with the old cookies will not be included on user profiles unless that data can be matched to some other identifier (e.g., an email or user ID). However, the data lost from turning on cookie culling can be found again if the feature is turned off or if the time range is shortened so that the cookie associated with the missing data is no longer skipped.",
        "The following information has been updated as of January 31, 2020.",
        "Cookies are used for persistent login, preference storage, and tracking across websites. Google, Apple, and other browser providers have deployed functionality that can block the tracking of users across websites. This functionality is promoted as privacy-enhancing by giving a user greater control to prevent website tracking. The technology generally focuses on third-party cookies, but Apple’s technology also focuses on certain first-party cookies.",
        "Apple introduced its Intelligent Tracking Protection (ITP) functionality in 2017 to block the use of cookies deployed on sites not belonging to the party issuing the cookie. You can track Safari ITP changes on Apple’s WebKit website. Generally, Safari has set a 7-day expiration period on first-party cookies but a shorter 1-day setting on certain cookies used with link decoration. This means for users that don’t revisit a site within seven days to extend their expiration, the cookie will be deleted, and these users will get new identifiers the next time they visit the site.",
        "Like Safari, Firefox blocks third-party cookies by default through Enhanced Tracking Protection.",
        "In 2019 Google announced it was changing its approach to third-party cookies by not blocking them by default and recommending cookie developers use SameSite attributes. Chrome gives users options to block the cookies they want to block and to delete cookies after a session (fingerprinting out as well).",
        "In mid-January of 2020, Google announced its intent to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome by 2022.",

At the \"Choose Authorization\" step, you can opt to create a new authorization which will direct you to the authorizations wizard in a new tab. You will be prompted to choose the method and configure the authorization before configuring your job.",
        "Note that some integration providers only have one authorization method, but others offer multiple methods such as API keys, OAuth, etc. Specific methods may enable different jobs, such as real-time vs. bulk audience exports. If you are unsure which method to use, you can find more information in your provider's integration documentation.",

        "If adjusting permissions in the external tool does not apply or is not an option, you may need to create a new authorization to use with your jobs in Lytics. You can optionally delete the unhealthy authorization.",
        "You can edit or delete authorizations directly in the Lytics UI using the buttons at the top right of each authorization summary page. The edit option allows you to rename the authorization and revise the description, but the configuration options cannot be changed. If you need a different configuration, you must create a new Authorization, and you can delete the previous one.",
        "You can only delete an authorization if no active jobs use it. If there are associated jobs with a running, sleeping, or paused status, you must delete those associated jobs before deleting the authorization. Likewise, you will need to delete any imported Experiences that are actively using an authorization before deleting that authorization.",

        "Identity Resolution is a crucial component of customer communication. Establishing and maintaining a well-defined identity resolution strategy is essential, but it can be overwhelming to get started. Several challenges may arise, such as limited and outdated customer data, data silos, technical difficulties, in-flexibility, consistency, compliance, and maintenance.",
        "Lytics offers a solution that powers brands' identity resolution strategies by aggregating data from disparate sources, defining a standardized customer schema, unifying disparate sources, surfacing individual consumer profiles, enabling better understanding, segmentation, and activation across channel tools, ensuring control, visibility, flexibility, security, privacy, and compliance, and maximizing match rates and accuracy across activation channels.",
        "The goal is to construct complex consumer profiles and maintain accurate and compliant user profiles as your brand evolves. Defining the relationship between consumer identifiers is a necessary first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements. To achieve this, we've broken our approach into three components:",
        "",
        "",
        "Profile definition is the first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements.",
        "To build a strong identity resolution strategy, three key questions must be answered:",
        "",
        "Data is messy. Lytics' Profile Materialization provides a necessary cleansing & polishing layer atop the defined resolution strategy. This ensures what is surfaced is accurate and accessible and enables your team to accelerate impact.",
        "Answering the following two key questions guarantee profiles represent the ideal marketable entity:",
        "",
        "Over time profiles will bloat, attributes will become stale, and use cases become more complex. If unmanaged, a quality identity strategy will begin breaking down the moment it is implemented.",
        "Lytics prevents your identity strategy from breakdown through a set of powerful tools focused on ensuring the following profile health-related questions have concrete answers:",
        "Behind each Lytics profile is an identity graph.  This graph represents connections between pieces of data observed across multiple sources or even within a single source.",
        "To create (or update) profiles from a data stream, the stream must contain one or more identity keys that identify distinct users with which to associate the data.  When data is observed for a given identity key, it stores the relevant profile metadata in an object called an identity fragment.  When there's evidence on a data stream  that two keys or fragments should be connected",
        "When evidence on a data stream shows that two keys or fragments identify the same real-world entity, those fragments become connected in the same identity graph.  Some identity graphs are significant and represent complex relationships in the data. In contrast, other identity graphs are small and describe a small interaction, like an anonymous cookie from a single-visit, incognito browser.",
        "",
        "As you learned from the identity resolution overview, a profile comprises one or more identity fragments.  Many profiles start as singletons – new data is observed on a data stream. That event's identifier keys create any necessary identity fragments and store the event's associated data on that fragment.",
        "However, we're not satisfied with several singletons – our objective is to stitch data sources together by linking the appropriate underlying fragments.  Stitching occurs when we observe two identifiers in a single event.  A common stitching event is a newsletter signup, where the email address from the newsletter form is linked to the cookie from their web activity and creates a link between activity from the browser on the device and any activity associated with the email address, which could eventually encompass purchases, support tickets, CRM data, etc.",
        "In graph terms, stitching creates an edge between two nodes representing two identity fragments.  If we wanted to retrieve a profile associated with an email address, we would retrieve all of the fragments with edges or connections to other fragments.  From there, we'd want to find all of the connections to those other fragments, and so on, until there are no more connections to follow.  Following one fragment to another is called traversal.  The full set of fragments that are found to have connections to the initial fragment are called neighbors.",
        "In Lytics, default graph limits cap the number of traversals allowed for an individual profile at 50 and cap the number of neighbors allowed at 50.  Changing these values can create different sets of user profiles over the same data set and should not be adjusted lightly.  To change these values for your data, please contact Lytics support.",
        "As we traverse identity graphs, we'll quickly find that identity fragments and their corresponding identity keys are not all created equal. An identifier's strength must contribute proportionally to its influence on identity resolution.",
        "For example, you have email addresses and cookies as identity keys.  Generally, a user identified with an email address can have multiple cookie values (from different devices, browsers, periods, etc.).  Imagine hosting a promotional, in-person event and having multiple tablets collecting participants' email addresses.  Depending on how those email addresses are collected (most likely through an online form), you'll likely have one cookie associated with many email addresses.",
        "",
        "Field types for Identity Keys can be either a string or a string set.  String sets are a common field type for cookies since one profile is expected to have many cookie values over time.  Email addresses are not so cut-and-dry.  Some organizations will constrain profiles to have one email address, while others will allow profiles to have multiple (personal, work, etc.).  In our example of email collection via physical tablet, if the email address is a single-valued string type, we won't end up with an over-merged hairball.",
        "Using an identity key that allows for a set of values is usually a good idea to have a sensical capacity cap on the field type.  A set of cookies, for example, might have a capacity limit of 50 values.  On the other hand, a set of emails might have a capacity limit of 5 values.",
        "The ranking of your identity keys should reflect their reliability and their relative importance in the strategy.  In the event of a conflict in stitching and merging, higher-ranked identity keys will win.  Typically, most Lytics users configure email identifiers to be ranked higher than cookie identifiers.",
        "Imagine a scenario where email A is connected to cookies X and Y, while email B is connected to cookie Z.  If new data is observed that connects email B with cookie Y, we have a conflict, meaning that a resulting stitching between the two fragments would yield a profile with two different email fragments and violates our merge rules.",
        "The ranks of identity keys would dictate that, for the new event, the email address it contains is of a higher priority than the cookie value that it contains and would consequently update the profile for Email A and not the profile for Email B.",
        "We mentioned that a critical tenet of bulletproof identity resolution is that profile complexity remains stable over time.  That is, we need a way to ensure that a relatively greedy algorithm doesn't result in profiles becoming more fragile and susceptible to conflicts.",
        "In Lytics, that is accomplished via graph compaction, a process by which data from multiple fragments is combined into a single fragment.  Doing so allows well-established relationships in the graph to be solidified while making room for new relationships within the profile.  It functions more as a type of profile housekeeping to keep profile fragments tidy.",
        "Compaction in identity graphs can take on a few forms.",
        "Let's go back to our example with Email A and Email B.  The point of identity resolution within a customer data platform is to enable long and rich relationships with customers.  The longer that Email A and Email B represent profiles in the platform, the more cookies with which they'll eventually become connected.  Each identity key's ranking allows an identity graph to compact by size or time.",

        "For more information on Lytics' security and privacy program, please visit Lytics' trust center at https://trust.lytics.com/",
        "As businesses continue to collect and utilize customer data to power their marketing efforts, obtaining, managing, and enforcing proper consent is crucial. This is important for complying with various privacy laws and regulations and maintaining trust with customers. This document will explore the importance of granularity in a consent strategy and how Lytics can assist in the consent management process. We will cover best practices to consider and provide guidance on where to get started. The following four steps will be outlined:",
        "By following these steps, businesses can establish a solid and effective consent management strategy that respects customer privacy and builds trust.",
        "To maintain compliance with data privacy regulations, businesses need a clear and flexible path for collecting consent data. Lytics offers a range of SDKs and data collection APIs to support this effort. When approaching consent data collection, it is essential to consider the following:",
        "To address these considerations, Lytics has developed a suggested schema to get you started. Of course, this can always be customized via Conductor to meet your specific needs.",
        "Effective consent management requires a comprehensive set of properties that can be deployed to ensure compliance and maintain customer trust. These properties should cover various aspects of data collection, storage, and usage and provide businesses with the tools to manage consent-related data effectively.",
        "We are here to help!",
        "Consent is not a one size fits all scenario. Each customers data and business goals are unique. Before deploying any of the following examples it is always recommended to consult with your Technical Account Manager or a Solutions Architect.",
        "Lytics deploys a flexible data model, and though the following is not representative of every method of collection, we've highlighted two working examples leveraging our available SDKs as a baseline:",
        "When using Lytics SDKs, you do not have to include date within the data passed in the consent event. The timestamp of the consent event can be used to create the field and mapping for the date of consent.",
        "Building from the collection strategy outlined in Collecting Consent Data, we must determine how to materialize the consent-related data we've just collected to user profiles for segmentation. This can be achieved in a variety of ways. Regardless of the approach, however, it is essential to consider the level of granularity of the consent.",
        "When collecting consent from users, obtaining granular consent for each specific use of a customer's personal data is an important consideration. Granular consent means that customers are provided with a clear understanding of the exact purposes for which their personal data will be used and can choose to consent or withhold consent for each specific use case.",
        "For example, a business may seek granular consent from a customer to collect their email address and use it to send them promotional emails but not to share the email address with third-party partners for advertising purposes. This approach allows customers to make more informed decisions about how their personal data is used and provides greater control over their privacy.",
        "Obtaining granular consent not only requires careful planning and clear communication with customers about the specific use cases for their personal data but also a rock-solid means for enforcing an individual's consent wishes across all future touchpoints.",
        "Enforcement begins by ensuring consent wishes are accurately materialized on each user's profile. This is done by first defining consent-related attributes to be used in segmentation.",
        "When defining profile fields, there are two primary considerations. What type of field should be used, such as a string or a map and how do you want to handle data merging when profiles are stitched?",
        "Type String\nBecause consent is something that may change for a consumer over time, the values must represent the most recent data. As such, the latest merge operator is always recommended. This means that as additional data is stitched to a user profile, the most recent events that are mapped to a field will win.",
        "",
        "Type Map\nFor a more complex or granular consent strategy, the map field type can be very helpful in accurately managing consent. As such, the merge merge operator is always recommended when trying to keep the key-value pairs up to date to the most recent consent state. This means that as additional data is stitched to a user profile, the most recent events that are mapped to a key-value pair will win.",
        "",
        "Mappings are then leveraged to determine how data from any number of streams map to the defined field. In the example below, we take a simple approach to map the boolean value of true or false to the consent field if the consent is related to marketing-consent.",
        "Though this is one elementary example, the same practice can be replicated to ensure a consent attribute has the status, timestamp, and context of any important policies or sources for segmentation.",
        "",
        "Businesses can better understand their customers and create more effective campaigns by breaking down audiences into smaller, more targeted segments. Here we will discuss best practices for constructing \"building block\" audiences related to consent that can then be leveraged in campaign audiences. This progressive approach ensures consent rules are enforced while minimizing ongoing maintenance overhead.",
        "Building Block Audiences provide the perfect means to maintain consent-related rules and extend the ruleset to all campaign audiences. The number and these audiences will depend on the granularity of your consent strategy. Still, as a basic example, we recommend creating both a \"has consented\" and \"has not consented\" counterpart for each level of consent.",
        "This can be done simply through the GUI for our powerful segmentation engine, as shown below:",
        "",
        "Once you have the necessary building blocks constructed, you can quickly integrate that rule set into your campaign audiences again through the GUI for our segmentation engine. The example below outlines a use case where you want to target high-value users who have opted in.",
        "",
        "Configure a segment to prevent profiles from being sent to downstream destinations based on consent status or another relevant filter. This ensures that individuals who should be excluded will not be activated downstream.",

        "An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.",
        "First-party cookies are created by the host domain – the domain the user is visiting. These cookies are generally considered good; they help provide a better user experience and keep the session open. This means the browser can remember key information, such as items you add to shopping carts, username, and language preferences.",
        "Third-party cookies are those created by domains other than the one the user is visiting at the time and are mainly used for tracking and online-advertising purposes. They also allow website owners to provide certain services, such as live chats.",
        "Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember.",
        "User preferences, themes, and other settings.",
        "Recording and analyzing user behavior.",
        "Cookies are one of the preferred methods for maintaining a user identifier in the browser, both known and anonymous. This gets associated with all inbound events captured by our Javascript tag as they interact with customer websites. Specifically, our Javascript tag stores a string of digits and characters that are used as a unique ID commonly referred to as our _uid or, in some cases seerid as a first-party cookie.",
        "In web development, the client-side refers to everything in a web application displayed on the client (end-user device). This includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any actions an application performs within the user's browser.",
        "When someone refers to a “client-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and/or managed via a common client-side programming language such as Javascript.",
        "Like with client-side, server-side means everything that happens on the server instead of on the client. In the past, nearly all business logic ran on the server-side, including rendering dynamic webpages, interacting with databases, identity authentication, and push notifications.",
        "When someone refers to a “server-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and managed using one of the many common server-side programming languages such as NodeJS, PHP, Python, etc.",
        "Defines the cookie name. Generally, the cookie name is the primary way of retrieving a cookie and its associated value and attributes.",
        "The stored value for the cookie. This can include any US-ASCII character excluding a control character, whitespace, double quotes, comma, semicolon, and backslash.",
        "Indicates the maximum lifetime of the cookie as an HTTP-date timestamp. See Date for the required formatting.",
        "Indicates the number of seconds until the cookie expires. A zero or negative number will expire the cookie immediately.",
        "Defines the host to which the cookie will be sent.",
        "Indicates the path that must exist in the requested URL for the browser to send the Cookie header.",
        "This indicates that the cookie is sent to the server only when a request is made with the HTTPS: scheme (except on localhost) and, therefore, is more resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "Forbids JavaScript from accessing the cookie, for example, through the Document.cookie property. Note that a cookie created with HttpOnly will still be sent with JavaScript-initiated requests, for example, when calling XMLHttpRequest.send() or fetch(). This mitigates attacks against cross-site scripting (XSS).",
        "Controls whether or not a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF).",
        "In June 2017, Apple introduced a new privacy feature called Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP). This same feature was officially released in September 2017 with Safari 12 and iOS 11. Since then, the ITP has evolved and introduced several subsequent versions leading us to the current state (as of July 2022), which has many impacts on marketing but most notably:",
        "As a result of the privacy and security efforts in general other browsers such as Mozilla’s Firefox(ETP) and Google Chrome have followed suit in announcing and/or implementing their security and tracking protocols, which continue to impact tools such as third and first-party cookies that have long been a staple in providing the data necessary for marketers to personalize their communications effectively.",
        "With each iteration on more stringent privacy-related changes comes a wave of workarounds or alternate approaches to maintaining access to behavioral data essential to marketing:",
        "There is no replacement then a strong identification strategy. Creating a relationship in which a user will openly share their identity through a login or some other authenticated means will always result in the highest level of certainty on identity, which leads to the best level of personalization. However, many use cases focus on anonymous users or users who have not built up the relationship necessary to unlock this level of authentication.",
        "Though third-party cookies are effectively dead, first-party cookies are still viable for many use cases. Not only do they offer a very simple off-the-shelf type of implementation for leveraging, they also have a long shelf life, assuming that an anonymous user interacts frequently enough to overcome the 7-day expiration window.",
        "Over the past 12 months, there has been a surge of interest in server-side cookies. This method for setting cookies currently is not affected by the ITP changes that impact client-side cookies, most notably the automatic expiration at seven days. Rather, server-side cookies can live for long periods, leading to a higher quality identification for anonymous users. The downside, however, is they are far more difficult to leverage than the client-side. They require a much more technical integration with whatever server-side technology is used to power the web asset and may not be accessible in the same manner as client-side cookies.",
        "In general, regardless of the specific attribute settings used when leveraging server-side cookies, they currently are not impacted by the 7-day expiration window that client-side cookies fall victim to. However, Apple has made it clear that they have additional plans to extend some of the client-side cookie limitations to the server-side, and the most important attribute in that discussion is the HttpOnly attribute.",
        "https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/",
        "As a CDP and technology leader, we always aim to help our customers future-proof their implementations. As such, even though a non-HttpOnly server-side cookie offers an easier means to bypass current client-side restrictions, it is our recommendation to consider investing to leverage HttpOnly cookies set by the server-side to prevent any potential impacts of the next few iterations of ITP. Below we’ll explore the two options and demonstrate the key differences.",
        "The following example in Node.js demonstrates a sample snippet for setting the cookie server side. Most server-side languages have existing methods to make this very easy. In the case of creating a cookie for Lytics to leverage, you will also need to generate a unique ID which can be done in a variety of ways. In the case of Node, you may consider using the randomUUID() method of the Crypto interface. A simple Google search can lead you or your developer down the road of generating a unique ID that best fits your use case.",
        "Once you have that unique ID, you simply set the cookie using the pre-defined Lytics name our Javascript tag is looking for. Alternatively, the tag can be configured to use any custom name.",
        "Since non-HttpOnly cookies are accessible out of the box client-side there is no additional lift necessary. Our tag will pick up the cookie and use that ID as the identifier. It is important to note that any UID changes must also be managed server-side as setting the cookie client-side will engage the 7-day expiration max. In this example, we simply raise an alert with the cookie string and do not show the actual implementation of the Lytics tag.",
        "Setting HttpOnly to true comes with an additional level of complexity but benefits from following the stringent and recommended guidelines of Apple ITP, which in theory will go farther in the way of future-proofing.",
        "Much like the above example, we’ll set a cookie, in this case using Node, in the same way. The only difference here is setting httpOnly to true. This means that the cookie is secure but will no longer be accessible out of the box by Javascript. Rather, you’ll have to implement an alternative method for surfacing that ID to Javascript so that it can be passed to the Lytics Javascript tag and used during collection/resolution.",
        "All code examples in this document are purely for demonstration. Any customer facing implementation should follow the guidance of our customer facing technical teams and the technical experts on our customer’s end. These examples in production represent HIGH risk as documented.",

        "Content curation on Lytics involves scanning your website and other content to ingest topics and build content affinities. Properly setting up the curation process is key to enabling use cases such as promoting relevant ads and delivering targeted web content.",
        "This document gives an overview of important concepts and considerations to make while curating your content during the early stages of implementation. It will also help determine if any custom content curation should be planned for.",
        "Ensure that any content customization is performed to support your campaign execution and audience building, not for the sake of customization itself.",
        "Once the Lytics JavaScript tag is installed, Lytics automatically begins crawling the content on your website using Natural Language Processing (NLP) engines. Put simply, this means that:",
        "Lytics will index your content producing a list of all your content. By default, content includes your web pages and images.",
        "Lytics will crawl the content via NLP providers (such as Google NLP or Diffbot, and extract topics associated with that content.",
        "Over time, as users interact with your content, Lytics identifies user content affinity levels for various topics. While this functionality begins working right away without you having to do anything, there are various things to consider to ensure Lytics is bringing in the content you’ll need to execute use cases.",
        "By default, Lytics will scan all content on your domains. You can specify which domains Lytics will scan by adding domains to the \"Domain Allowlist\", which can be modified by navigating to Account Settings > Content.",
        "If there are only certain sections of your website Lytics should be scanning, you can customize by allowing or blocking specific paths as well. For example, if you have a blog section and other pages won’t be relevant to gauge what users are interested in, you can add the path /blog/ to the list of allowed paths.",
        "You can see which domains have been improved in the domain and path settings on the Content Classification page. Visit the content account settings documentation for detailed instructions on how to add more domains or paths.",
        "A website may have sections that should not be scanned for topics such as password reset pages or any pages hidden behind a log-in (e.g. /password-reset/ or /admin/). These paths can be blocked in your Account Settings under Content.",
        "Lytics uses Google NLP which pulls from their knowledge graph/taxonomy. If you determine you're not getting enough topics from your content, Lytics can use Diffbot in addition to Google NLP, which has more loose associations between topics and content. You'll bring in more topics, but may be slightly surprised by what you see!",
        "If your brand is international, you may need to consider which languages are supported by each NLP service. Please consult the provider documentation for a list of languages supported by Google NLP and Diffbot. Another option is to turn NLP completely off and use only custom topics.",
        "For more details on each service Lytics uses, see NLP services.",
        "If you aren’t seeing the content you expected to, note it may take some time for Lytics to crawl all of your content. By default, monthly limits exist for scanning new content (see Content Enrichment limits below). If Lytics scans all new content without having reached the limit, Lytics will move on to older content until it is all scanned. Please allow time for this.",
        "Also, consider how far back should Lytics be scanning. For example, it is likely unnecessary to scan content from 2 years ago. If people are no longer interacting with that content, use Account Settings to set a date to start the scan from.",
        "Lytics will scan and enrich up to 20,000 URLs per month by default. This limit is designed to act as a guard rail to ensure good filter hygiene is in place. Most accounts do not publish close to 20,000 pieces of distinct content per month. If you believe your account is hitting this limit, please check with your Lytics Implementation team. Once confirmed, you can consider the following options:",
        "Your domain likely has a robot directive (e.g. domain.com/robots.txt) that provides instructions to crawlers on how to crawl or index your content. Lytics will follow these directives. While typically not an issue, it’s worth turning to your directives when troubleshooting any missing content or information.",
        "You may want to build a collection of content based on publish date or author. Consider the following if this is the case:",
        "If you have metadata on your website, is it using OpenGraph? Open Graph tags will populate the following default values in Lytics:\ntitle, image, published_time, description, and lytics:topics. You can check the lytics_content query in your account to check if all the Open Graph tags you need are being picked up.",
        "If you are not using Open Graph, Lytics may not be picking up any meta tags automatically. The quickest way to check that Lytics is bringing is to use our find a document tool to view the data Lytics has for a specific piece of content. Navigate to Content > Find a Document and search for the URL of the piece of content you would like to view.",
        "If you make changes to your content's metadata and would like to preview those changes you can use our manual classification tool located at the bottom of the Content > Classification dashboard. Enter the URL with the updated metadata and click Get Details. Lytics will scan the document and display a preview of the updated metadata. If you are satisfied with the changes click Complete Classification. If not, you can make additional edits and preview again.",
        "Alternatively, you can check by navigating to Content > Collections. Try to build content collections by author or publish date as these are the most commonly used filters. If the content doesn’t come up as expected, you may need to curate your tags.",
        "For many users outside of publishing who may not have rich content, NLP derived topics aren’t enough. To accommodate this, Lytics can add custom topics via the metadata. The easiest way to do this is by adding the lytics:topics meta tag. Read more on providing custom topics.",
        "If you already have topics in your metadata using a different meta tag than the above, it’s possible Lytics may be able to bring those in as well by making a change to your account settings. Speak with your implementation team about this.",
        "Once this setting is changed and content is rescanned, you will be able to build content collections with this topic, and users' affinities will be generated for these new topics.",
        "In the Lytics UI, you will see a max of 500 topics. Lytics keeps all of your topics, but only the top 500 are surfaced in the UI.",
        "If you choose to allow topics, make sure that the topics actually exist - either as custom topics or are being generated by NLP. Case sensitivity is important when adding topics to the allow list. For example, allowing ABBA is different than allowing Abba.",
        "If you have other content on your site outside of web pages or images (e.g. PDFs) that you’d like to derive topics from and have them generate affinities, Lytics will need to develop a plan to bring those in using our APIs.",
        "All topics - NLP derived or custom topics - will allow for two things:",
        "There are instances where you may want to build collections based on a topic, but not have them generate affinities. For example, a collection of featured sale items, SKUs, genres, etc. You can set these as document properties in your metadata to allow for this.",

        "Using data science techniques to look at the topic overlap between classified content, Lytics will programmatically build a topic taxonomy. In addition to programmatically building this taxonomy, Lytics dynamically adjusts the taxonomy as new content gets published.",
        "The topic taxonomy is stored as a weighted and directional graph. Although this structure may be daunting to look at—and even more daunting to try and utilize by hand—Lytics uses it when determining content recommendations.",
        "",
        "Topics are determined to be related by evaluating how they occur together and how they occur independently. When two topics occur together frequently (meaning in multiple documents), it is safe to assume they are related. In addition to the relationship existing, Lytics will determine the direction of the relationship. Is \"Cookies\" a subtopic of \"Baking\" or is \"Baking\" a subtopic of \"Cookies\"?",
        "The co-occurrence of topics determines the relationship. The independent occurrence of a topic determines the direction. Since the topic \"Cookies\" frequently occurs with \"Baking,\" but \"Baking\" frequently occurs without \"Cookies,\" \"Cookies\" must be a subtopic of \"Cookies.\" To draw this example further, \"Baking\" may be a subtopic of \"Recipes,\" \"Recipes\" may be a subtopic of \"Cooking,\" and \"Cooking\" may be a subtopic of \"Hobbies.\"",
        "This is important because it allows Lytics to make affinity inferences. A user with a high affinity for \"Cookies\" may be interested in general \"Baking\" content.",
        "The weight between relationships is incredibly important to consider when making affinity inferences. For instance, Michael Jordan played baseball professionally for one dark year in the 90s. This means there are valid relationships between Michael Jordan and Baseball and Michael Jordan and Basketball. Most people who know anything about sports or pop culture know Michael Jordan as a basketball icon. The way this gets reflected in taxonomy is through relationship weights. The weight between Michael Jordan and Basketball is strong, while the weight between Michael Jordan and Baseball is weak.",
        "By having weights, affinity inferences can use those weights as thresholds for building further relationships or recommending content. A user who has shown interest in Michael Jordan is more likely to be interested in Basketball than they are to be interested in Baseball. Unless they are interested in Sports Icons From The 90s, they might be more interested in Ken Griffey Jr. A rich topic taxonomy will surface this nuanced information.",
        "A graph is the ideal data structure for topic taxonomies and taxonomies in general. Since each topic can have many subtopics and be the subtopic of many things, the correct way to structure this data is with a graph.",

        "Lytics offers pre-built integrations for many of today’s most popular marketing tools to ease the onboarding and exporting of data. These integrations are available in the Data tab of the Lytics platform under Data > Jobs. Each of these marketing tools has specific instructions for setup found in our integrations documentation.",
        "The implementation type refers to the development methods used to implement the job. Usually this depends on the third-party provider's capabilities and the resources they provide to outside developers such as APIs or SDKs. Integrations may be client-side or server-side.",
        "Client-side integrations are implemented in browser-facing code. These are implemented through the Lytics JavaScript tag and usually require you to have a tag from the third-party provider also installed on your web page. Given the nature of these integrations being tightly coupled to the browser session, these integrations collect and send data in real time. There are two types of client-side integrations:",
        "A push integration pushes data from Lytics, such as surfaced fields or audience membership of users to the third party. Examples of push integrations include personalization tools such as Pathfora SDK which uses Lytics user data to personalize the page with content based on audience membership, or data management platforms (DMPs) such as Krux, which transmits Lytics user information to the DMP.",
        "A pull integration pulls data from the third party and imports it into Lytics. This data will differ based on the provider, and the exact fields available in the audience builder will be listed in the respective integration document. An example of this type of integration includes the Lytics JavaScript tag communicating with a data layer object on your website to collect data from various third-party vendors such as Tealium or even a custom implementation.",
        "Server-side integrations allow Lytics and the third-party service to communicate directly, usually in the form of a job. These jobs are available to set up and execute in the Lytics platform under Data > Jobs. There are two main types of Server-side integrations:",
        "As the name implies, import integrations ingest data into Lytics. This data will differ based on the provider and job type. It can be anything from identifying information, demographic data, subscription status, or activity data for a user. Examples of import integrations include the Amplitude Cohorts Import which imports user data from Amplitude.",
        "Export integrations send user profile data from Lytics to a third-party tool, usually at the audience level. You can select which audience(s) you want to export, and include user data such as user fields, audience membership and more such as the SendGrid User Export. However, some integrations may export raw event data or metrics for monitoring such as the BigQuery Event Export or the New Relic Insights Monitoring job.",
        "An enrichment integration uses a third-party service to enhance and enrich existing user profiles within Lytics. These integrations require Lytics to push a list of user identifiers (defined by an audience of known users) to a third-party enrichment tool. That tool then returns additional data on that user such as information on the user's company (for B2B marketing), or additional demographic and social data. Examples of enrichment integrations include Full Contact Audience Enrichment and Clearbit User Enrichment jobs.",
        "Many providers support both import and export job types for a complete two-way data sync between Lytics and the third-party tool.",
        "Client and server-side integrations may be implemented in a number of different ways. The implementation technique often determines factors such as Tier, Frequency, and Resulting Data.",
        "All default client-side integrations somehow utilize the Lytics JavaScript tag. The tag implements functions for sending data to a data stream and receiving user profile data which has been surfaced. Behind the scenes, these functions utilize some of the public Lytics API endpoints.",
        "API integrations utilize REST or SOAP APIs the third-party vendor provides to send or receive data. The specific endpoints used are listed in the documentation for the integration. Lytics prefers to integrate with third parties via API as it provides a deeper out-of-the-box integration.",
        "Audience triggers are used in conjunction with an API implementation for export or enrichment job types. Audience triggers are powered by an internal system called subscriptions. Subscriptions listen to specific events, such as when a user has entered or exited an audience. A subscription can then send a trigger to any job listening to the subscription. Once received, the job can push the updated user data to the third-party tool via APIs. This process enables real-time exports versus a scheduled batch export.",
        "Lytics supports file-based import and export jobs.",
        "Files may be obtained or pushed to a server via Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). SFTP integrations may be provided for third-party vendors who do not have API capabilities or as part of a custom integration. Lytics has a managed SFTP server that can be used to transfer files, or it may retrieve files from a third-party SFTP server.",
        "Another example of a file-based export is via Email Attachment, such as the CSV Email Export.",
        "Many third-party vendors offer webhooks or API callbacks, which send requests containing relevant user-activity data to another service after an event has occurred in the system. The Lytics API has a collection endpoint that can be used as a destination for third-party webhooks. Providers that support webhooks will have documentation detailing the preferred setup method for Lytics to receive webhook data.",
        "In addition, Lytics supports webhooks that can be configured to send user-level events, such as real-time audience membership updates.",
        "Frequency describes when and how often that data is sent or received. It attempts to answer common questions such as: \"When will I see data in my tool?\" and \"Can I keep my data up-to-date?\" Lytics integrations are either real-time or scheduled.",
        "A number of different integration types are considered real-time (or \"near\" real-time). In that, user data is sent or received downstream as soon as the data is available in the native system. The following types of integrations are considered real-time:",
        "Jobs that use audience triggers also often have an option to perform a backfill of users. Without a backfill, only new users who enter the audience after the time of job setup will be processed. Enabling a one-time backfill as part of the job configuration will immediately process a batch of all existing users in the audience to the third-party tool and then rely on real-time triggers to update user information once the backfill is finished. Some jobs support this feature as a configurable option. If so, it is listed under the \"Frequency\" section of \"Integration Details\" in a job's documentation.",
        "Batch integrations send or receive user data in larger batches. Depending on the configuration of the job, it may only import/export a single batch of users once, or it may run continuously, checking for new users and updates to existing user data.",
        "The final way Lytics categorizes integrations is by the type of data it handles and how the job output is perceived. The resulting export and push integration data will vary based on the structures supported by the provider tool, and each integration will document the specific output type. Here is a list of common data types in Lytics for import and pull integrations:",
        "When you import users, you will likely see new user profiles created for users that previously did not have data associated with them in Lytics. However, you may also see updates to existing users' profiles, if Lytics is able to recognize an existing user based on the identity resolution strategy for your account.",
        "The new user fields that are created as part of an integration are listed in the \"Fields\" section of each doc. These fields will be added to new and existing user profiles as described in the section above, and they will become available for segmentation in the audience builder.",
        "If data is imported to Lytics without being mapped by LQL, this data is stored as raw fields in data streams, which are un-actionable. For example, if you are importing custom data via CSV, you will need queries in place for the raw data to be meaningful. In addition, some pre-built integrations may import additional fields that are not mapped as part of the default queries provided by the out-of-the-box integration. You may contact support for assistance with mapping these fields.",
        "In addition to user data, some integrations may ingest content that can be analyzed and processed by the Lytics Content Affinity Engine. An example of this is the MailChimp Import which, in addition to user data, brings in content from your MailChimp email campaigns. This content can help inform affinity scores for users who have viewed and interacted with the email.",
        "This is an uncommon pattern in existing integrations, but Lytics can also import specific metrics from third-party tools. For example, in the Goal Canvas, Facebook Experience metrics are imported directly from the Facebook Insights API. Metrics that are imported to Lytics are accessible via the Metrics API.",
        "File imports and exports can be decrypted and encrypted, respectively using\nPretty Good Privacy (PGP). To create or ingest PGP encrypted files, use an authorization that includes PGP keys.",
        "Follow the instructions below when creating a PGP authorization.",
        "Use a PGP Public Key authorization to encrypt file exports. You will need to generate an armored PGP key pair if you haven't already.",
        "In the PGP Public Key field, enter your public key. Be sure to include the header and footer of the armored key. This means your entry should begin and end with the following:",
        "-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- and -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----",
        "If your key does not begin and end with these strings respectively, it is possible it has not been ASCII armored.",
        "Use a PGP Private Key authorization to decrypt file imports. You will need the private key that is paired with the public key used to encrypt the file.",
        "In the PGP Private Key field, enter your private key. Be sure to include the header and footer of the armored key. This means your entry should begin and end with the following:",
        "-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK----- and -----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----",
        "If your key does not begin and end with these strings respectively, it is possible it has not been ASCII armored.",
        "If your private key has been protected with a passphrase, enter the passphrase in the field labeled PGP Private Key Passphrase. If your private key is not passphrase protected, leave this field empty.",
        "Note: in order for Lytics to decrypt the file successfully, you will need to provide the private key that is paired with the public key that was used to encrypt the file.",
        "User profile fields can be dynamically inserted into an alert using  templating of supported fields including the alert title, alert subtitle, and alert body fields. Lytics uses Golang's template package to provide this functionality. The data available to you will vary based on the data available on each individual profile.",
        "You can download a customer profile to see a list of fields available on your user profiles. For example, if you want to include a user's name in an alert and the field containing the name is called first_name, a template like the following could be used:",
        "Notice the \".\" before the name of the profile field.",
        "Some profiles may not have a first-name field. To avoid sending an incoherent alert when you don't have the first name field available, a template like the following could be used:",
        "Alternatively, if you would rather include a default name when the field does not exist on the profile, a template like the following could be used:",
        "If you would like to make sure that multiple fields on a profile exist, a template like the following could be used:",
        "To check equality on a particular profile field, you can create a template like the following:",

        "Lytics Job runtime and APIs control the mechanics of how data flows in and out of Lytics.  Lytics jobs can be generally broken down into a few important categories:",
        "Knowing which type of job you're dealing with can help guide expectations for behavior and troubleshooting.",
        "Some jobs, like specific Webhook flows, don't require explicit credentials to access external systems.  However, most jobs require some form of authorization to retrieve data from or send data to external systems.  In Lytics, these credentials are generically referred to as Authorizations.",
        "Authorizations can be managed from the Auth API, or directly from the Lytics interface.  All authorizations are either configuration-based or OAuth-based.",
        "Commonly, authorizations will change – some systems require periodic password changes, tokens get revoked, users who complete OAuth flows leave an organization, etc.  Consequently, a job that is running successfully with authorization today may fail tomorrow if the authorization is no longer valid.  If you know in advance that credentials will update or change, it is recommended that you create a new authorization and update the job to use the new one.",
        "To stay alerted on the health status of a job, you can set up alerts as described in the Monitoring section below.",
        "Jobs can be managed from the Jobs API, or directly from the Lytics interface.",
        "Each job has custom configuration options that tell the job when to run, what type of data to pull, which lists to pull data from in external systems, how to send the data to downstream sources, etc.  Each job's API endpoint will validate the presence of any required parameters, or other conditions that must be satisfied for the job to run correctly.  In the event of a validation error in the job configuration, the API will return a 400 error with a message indicating what is misconfigured.",
        "If the configuration for the job request is valid, the job will be immediately submitted to Lytics internal job running system.",
        "Jobs running on Lytics' internal job running system may be in any of the following states:",
        "Jobs will usually first enter into a Runnable state.  If the job is fed input from real-time triggers, it will stay running unless it encounters any errors.  If the job runs on a batched interval, it will usually switch between Runnable and Sleeping.",
        "",
        "While most transitions happen automatically in the system (Runnable → Completed, for example), some are triggered manually, namely:",
        "There are a variety of reasons a job will enter a Failed state, including:",
        "When an error occurs, the job will enter a Sleeping state, and retry a minute later.  If an error occurs on the second attempted run, the job will sleep double the amount of time as the previous run.  If errors still occur after two hours, the job will enter a Failed state.",
        "Any failed work can be manually restarted, through the Job API or through the Lytics interface.  If, for example, a job is in a failed state because of an authorization issue, you can create a new authorization for the job and restart it.",
        "Many jobs are maintained by Lytics, and even more workflows can be enabled by using our generic tooling for Webhook and SFTP-based integration flows.",
        "Some jobs are open-sourced and run on Conductor's Opus framework for running jobs. Check out our Conductor Opus Template on GiHub to get started creating your own jobs.",

This document will delve into the various data storage methods employed by Lytics and explain the purpose, access, and behavior of these different storage structures.",

        "The system records each unique identifier (ID) as separate nodes within the graph structure. A collection of nodes linked by edges corresponds to a singular profile. The data associated with the most robust ID present in an incoming event is stored. While not directly accessible via the API, this information is made available through the \"Identity\" tab in the conductor. The graph undergoes immediate updates upon the arrival of new events. Generally, the response time from a graph update to the corresponding entity ranges from milliseconds to seconds.",
        "Graph view of consumer profiles in Conductor",
        "The system efficiently stores every event received from Lytics, both in batch and real-time modes. Each event includes a timestamp indicating when the event took place and when it entered the Lytics system. Although this information is not directly accessible through the API or user interface (UI), it is possible to transmit the events downstream using our out-of-the-box (OOTB) integrations, such as the BigQuery (BQ) export feature. This scenario seamlessly transfers the events from the raw storage to designated downstream tables. These operations can be initiated or concluded at any given time. The raw storage option also serves as a valuable resource for replaying data in the event of corrupted or malformed data, ensuring data integrity throughout the account.",
        "The system diligently maintains and stores the latest Lytics profiles, ensuring their accuracy and relevance. These profiles encompass various attributes, such as scores and segment memberships. Users can conveniently access these profiles through the user interface (UI) using the Decision Engine functionality. Additionally, the profiles can be retrieved programmatically via the API, utilizing any of the existing profile IDs.",
        "To facilitate this process, you can reference the profile's URL in the UI, which contains the necessary ID value for API access.",

        "The transition from data entry to the updated entity is typically swift, with response times ranging from milliseconds to seconds. The updated entity is a valuable resource for real-time activations, including trigger-based exports, membership in client-side experiences or audiences, and client-side attribute updates. These functionalities enable seamless and immediate user interactions based on their up-to-date profiles.",

The system employs indexes on profile attributes to facilitate efficient retrieval and modifications, enabling fast access to the desired data. Users can conveniently access and interact with the audiences through the user interface (UI) using the Decision Engine feature. Alternatively, audiences can be accessed programmatically via the API, providing flexibility for data retrieval in a one-to-many fashion.",
        "Audiences can be created through Lytics Segment API using Segment QL, offering a powerful tool for audience customization. When referencing audiences in the UI, the Segment ID can be found within the URL, aiding API-based operations.",

        "As the last table to be updated after an event, the audience table exhibits a slightly longer update time compared to other components. However, since this table is not involved in real-time processes, it does not impact latency or affect the responsiveness of other functionalities.",
        "Note: To allow the system indexes on profile attributes, the creation of new fields will need to be added to this index first, creating an additional delay before new fields will be visible in the audience builder.",

It is a fundamental building block for audience segmentation and targeted campaigns within the Lytics platform.\nAudience view in Decision Engine",

        "As the landscape of data strategies within the Customer Data Platform (CDP) area progresses, cloud warehouses have emerged as a core element of the overarching marketing technology (martech) strategy. Centralizing customer data in a single repository enables enhanced, comprehensive customer insights while reducing exposure and failure points throughout the data pipeline.",
        "Nonetheless, this centralization poses the challenge of effectively leveraging this wealth of data across the martech stack for maximum value with minimal risk of additional data exposure and duplication.",
        "Lytics has developed the Cloud Connect product to address this, which serves as a materialized layer atop the cloud warehouse and facilitates direct segmentation and activation.",
        "This model allows customers to employ either SQL or AI to craft consumer audiences, which can subsequently be activated downstream.",
        "Importantly, this method does not involve long-term data storage within Lytics but instead generates a transient profile context that disappears once the Cloud Connect model is deleted.",
        "This strategy leverages the Zero Copy approach, utilizing Lytics' identification and data science capabilities. Hence, it transcends the limitations of data stored in the customer warehouse. Cloud Connect audiences can be enriched with Lytics' behavioral scores, profile affinities, content recommendations, and predictive models alongside Lytics' top-tier identity solution. Consequently, Lytics' customers can implement a dynamic, maintenance-light activation strategy over time.",

        "With the provider selected, we'll surface the various ways you can integrate with that particular provider. This will vary significantly by the provider.",
        "",
        "Each provider and job type may require additional authorization to finalize the connection. On the \"select authorization\" step, you can either select an existing authorization or create a new one. When creating a new authorization, you will be asked to provide the required credentials, such as key and secret, to proceed.",
        "",
        "You can create it during source configuration if you lack valid authorization for your desired provider/source combination. Click \"Create new Authorization\" above the list, follow the wizard in Vault, and return to where you left off.",

Once metrics are available for each job, this chart will become populated.",

        "The Logs section records the history of events for this job, details about the work completed, and the time each job was run. The logs are helpful to ensure your work is running as expected and for troubleshooting if any issues arise. Below are descriptions of the job events you may see in the logs.",
        "Some use cases involve having historical data available for segmentation.  This data might be demographic in nature, or describe how customers prefer to be contacted. This document offers guidelines for cases where large amounts of this data must be available in your Lytics account.",
        "A real-time data stream contains messages sent in response to the activity they describe. This is distinguished from batched data streams, where messages are sent in groups on a given schedule or according to another trigger.",

        "Backfill messages can be sent using multiple means. API loads should be sent via the bulk CSV or bulk JSON endpoints. It is also possible to use integration workflows to import this data, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3.",
        "The benefit of separating this data from real-time message streams is that the processing of backfill messages does not impact the processing time of messages received from real-time streams. The bulk imports are processed in parallel to real-time messages. This means that marketing activations reliant on real-time updates are not affected.",
        "Whenever possible, all messages should have an explicit timestamp. While all messages are additionally time stamped by Lytics at the time of ingestion, specifying a message timestamp is helpful in all circumstances, particularly in cases when messages are received out of order so that Lytics knows which one is the most up-to-date.  It is essential when a backfill occurs concurrently with a real-time stream of the same attribute.",
        "All means of loading data permit specifying timestamps. Via API, this is via a timestamp_field URL parameter. In the Admin UI, data import configuration options feature a menu to pick among the file schema for a timestamp field.",
        "All messages imported into your Lytics account are stored in their raw form and represented as profile attributes in the graph. The purpose of storing all messages is to enable the reprocessing of those messages, a process called rebuilding. Rebuilding enables all received messages to be represented differently with different attributes, identity resolution rules, etc.",
        "All data ingested into Lytics incrementally increase the overhead of rebuilding, making it a longer and more processing-intensive operation. Therefore, before importing large amounts of data, consider the value/benefit of that data. If there is no clear use case for backfilling, consider skipping it.",

        "A data stream is a continuous flow of data generated from various sources such as websites, mobile apps, email providers, social media, and other digital platforms. Data streams typically involve high volumes of data generated in real-time or near-real-time, making it necessary to process and analyze the data as it arrives.",
        "Lytics allows for creating any number of data streams to provide logical distinctions among data sources in either type or scope. For example, data describing email subscriber attributes should exist on a different data stream than one describing email subscriber activity. This ensures maximum flexibility when defining the relationships between sources and how they ultimately are unified into a materialized user profile.",
        "In Lytics, an \"event\" is an action or activity performed by a user or a customer, such as visiting a website, purchasing, or subscribing to a newsletter. As pictured below, events are showcased as independent key/value pairs on a single data stream. These keys are then translated into Fields & Mappings  in order to materialize to user profile for segmentation.",
        "",
        "Lytics will ingest data that is sent to one of Lytics' Collection APIs: the collect API or the bulk API. The bulk API is generally intended for larger imports of offline data, while the collect API is generally intended for more real-time sources and usage.",
        "You can view information about your data streams in your Lytics dashboard by navigating to Conductor > Pipeline > Streams. The primary purpose of this section is to verify that data is successfully being received by Lytics. If your account has multiple data streams, you can view a different stream from the dropdown menu above the graph.",
        "Many integrations have multiple streams. For instance, it is common for email integrations to have an activity stream and a user stream. Integration streams should be prefixed to help identify the source. You can find the streams for integration under the documentation for that integration.",
        "The number of keys in a data stream can be extremely large. This is normal and does not impact performance. Any keys that comprise less than 0.1% of the data volume OR have not been seen in 7 days will be hidden from display to reduce clutter.",
        "The event ingress graph shows the number of events collected on a stream for the selected time period (past day, week, month, 3 months, and year)  and interval (hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly). Above the graph, you will find the time the last message from this stream was received, the source of the data stream, and the number of fields in the stream.",
        "Last message received strives for real time reporting but can lag under a number of conditions including during bulk imports. If a data stream is not updating as expected please contact Lytics Support for assistance.",
        "",
        "Below the event ingress graph is the raw keys table. An event may contain any number of key-value pairs. Each record in this table represents a unique raw key seen on the stream in at least one event.",
        "",
        "The table has the following information on keys:",
        "In addition to these seven columns, each record in the table can be clicked to open up a set of sample values. This can be used to verify that values are being collected and they match the expected data.",
        "If a key has many different values, the modal may not display all the values for the chosen key.",
        "The table can be filtered in three ways: used vs. unused, common vs. uncommon, and text search.",
        "Raw event keys can be hidden, but it is important to note that keys cannot be made visible again through the user interface - only through the API. It is recommended that a list is kept of hidden keys in the event one needs to be resurfaced at a later date. If you need assistance, please contact Lytics Support with your key name and account ID.",
        "To hide a key:",
        "Having logically differentiated data streams for different data sources also helps to facilitate a more straightforward process for mapping data from data sources to user profiles. However, integrating data from some data providers can make this distinction difficult.  For example, data routers like Segment or Rudderstack can route data from multiple sources into a single destination, like Lytics.",

        "The mechanics of this imply one important distinction relative to V1 WHERE clauses: since route rules describe which records to redirect away from the input stream, rather than which records to evaluate for the input stream, they are in effect the inverse of WHERE clauses. If, for example, we want to ignore urls containing the string localhost from our input stream app in the WHERE clause above, we would need to define a route rule containing the following expression (which is the precise inverse of our WHERE clause):",
        "This tells the system to redirect events matching this expression to a new output stream we define on the route rule object. By convention, if we don't care about mapping records that match our route rule, we call that output stream {input-stream}_divert, and define the following route rule object (note the need to escape double quotes inside the expression so that our object is valid JSON):",

The Data-Type allows you to select the type of data used by the Template,  either User or Event (the default option is User ). The Template-Type configures the type of templating language used by the Template, either Jsonnet or Handlebars.js.",

        "Once the Sample Data has been selected, Step 2 involves specifying your desired JSON structure for your destination in the Template Co-Pilot text box. Consider the example below where we specify the structure of our JSON payload, with fields such as _uid, last_active_ts, last_name, and pillowcase_affinity(derived from the lytics_content field). We are also using the Find a User feature to populate the Sample Data. Note: this example is using the Additional Prompt text box to assist the Co-Pilot in generating the template. Here we are instructing the Co-Pilot to use the lytics_content field to derive the pillowcase_affinity template field.",
